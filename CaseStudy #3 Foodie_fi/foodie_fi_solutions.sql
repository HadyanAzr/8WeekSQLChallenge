-- A. Customer Journey

--Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.
--Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

	p.plan_name,

-- B. Data Analysis Questions

    -- 1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?
    -- 2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value
    -- 3. What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name
    -- 4. What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?
    -- 5. How many customers have churned straight after their initial free trial - what percentage is this rounded to the nearest whole number?
    -- 6. What is the number and percentage of customer plans after their initial free trial?
    -- 7. What is the customer count and percentage breakdown of all 5 plan_name values at 2020-12-31?
    -- 8. How many customers have upgraded to an annual plan in 2020?
    -- 9. How many days on average does it take for a customer to an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi?
